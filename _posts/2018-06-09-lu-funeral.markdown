content is available.

### Photos

The unedited JPEGs from Zhihong and Aaron are all uploaded to
Flickr. Flickr has trouble handling large albums so the photos are 
divivded into 7 ablums based on time. Clocks from 2 cameras are not
in sync so it's out of order sometimes.

All the photos are private (The link serves as password) so you can't
share the link for individual photos. 

If you want any photos edited, please give me the last 4 digit number.
For example, 9470 for `180609_143602.jpg_DSC_9470.jpg`.
